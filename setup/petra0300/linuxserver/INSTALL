required packages:
 mono-2.0-runtime
 sqlite3 (requires > 3.6.1), or postgresql

You need to link the config file for the server, depending whether you want to use sqlite or postgresql:
ln -s etc30/PetraServerConsole-postgresql.config etc30/PetraServerConsole.config
or 
ln -s etc30/PetraServerConsole-sqlite.config etc30/PetraServerConsole.config

Notes for sqlite:
it requires quite a new version of sqlite, which might not be available on your distribution of Linux.
If you use sqlite, it will automatically create a copy of the demo database, and put it into your home directory: 
~/.config/OpenPetra.org/db30/petra.db

Notes for postgresql:
TODO: how to load the initial database

firewall: 
in order for clients to connect from outside, you need to open ports 9000 and above (or what you have defined in your config files).
eg if you are using iptables, add such a line:
/sbin/iptables -A int-in -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport 9000:9100
 
To start the server with SQLite, type:

. start.sh

To see the menu and administrate the server, type:

. menu.sh

To stop the server, type:

. stop.sh
