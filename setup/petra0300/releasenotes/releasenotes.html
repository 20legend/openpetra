<h2>Release Notes OpenPetra.org (Preview)</h2>

<h3>0.0.13.0: 08 March 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>

<h3>0.0.12.0: 15 February 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
OpenPetra now supports Mysql as well as Postgresql and Sqlite.<br/>
The Remote Client installer and the patchtool now work with Windows Vista (and probably Windows 7 as well).<br/>
Export the database to text file, and import it into another OpenPetra installation. This allows easy migration between Standalone and Hosted installations, or between different database types.<br/>
Matching of gifts now works.<br/>
Printing of gifts receipts (form letters) has been implemented.<br/>

<h3>0.0.11.0: 11 January 2010</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
This version now supports importing partners from a Yml file.<br/>
The patchtool works now, this allows easy upgrades on the client side.<br/>
The server version now uses encryption to secure the communication between client and server.<br/>
It is possible to use a plugin dll for authentication against other services (eg. LDAP, phpBB database, etc).<br/>

<h3>0.0.10.0: 13 November 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
Import of account hierarchy works now. New accounts will be created automatically. This helps with customizing OpenPetra to the specific needs of an organisation.<br/>
Import of foreign currency exchange rates works now. This helps with displaying reports in international currency for auditors from other countries.<br/>
Income/Expense Sheet, Balance Sheet, and Account Detail reports now work and have been tested. Of course they still need improvements, especially for allowing the user which columns to print, reporting by quarter, etc.<br/>
GL transactions can be imported from Excel sheets (CSV files), with each column representing an account, and values in those columns are assigned to the correct accounts. A data definition file describes the date and currency format, and the account names for each column. This functionality can be adjusted for other situations; in the current case we can use it to import historic data from another office.<br/>

<h3>0.0.9.0: 12 October 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
AP payments can now be created for posted AP documents, and the payments are posted to GL. Partial payments are not supported yet, neither are payments in different currencies.<br/>
The account hierarchy can now be displayed in a treeview, and new accounts can be added. It does not work yet to move accounts around in the hierarchy, neither can you delete accounts yet.<br/>
You can export the account hierarchy to CSV, YML, or XML. This will help with editing the account hierarchy in an editor you prefer. The import of these files does not work yet.<br/>

<h3>0.0.8.0: 21 September 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
Posting of AP documents works now.<br/>
The new navigation system is basically working, though it should be extended soon to allow the user to customize it, and context sensitive search boxes will be added as well.<br/>
A new Demo folder has been added to the new navigation system to show the functionality that has already been implemented.<br/>
The classic navigation systems with the deep and complicated menu structure is still available, via a toolbar button.

<h3>0.0.7.0: 05 September 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
Some bugs from the previous release with Partner Edit and Partner Find have been fixed.<br/>
Those screens should now work better with Linux and Mac.<br/>
Posting of GL batches works now!<br/>
There is the report for Account details, which should show the transactions and balances affected.<br/>

<h3>0.0.6.0: 19 August 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
The General Ledger Batch/Journal/Transaction screen is now looking much better, and you can actually store batches, journals and transactions.
You can select Account codes and Cost centre codes for transactions.
<br/><br/>
A few improvements have been added to the Accounts Payable screens, hopefully there are less exceptions than before.

<h3>0.0.5.0: 25 July 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
It is now possible in Accounts Payable to create invoices and add invoice details, and store them. You can search for the supplier, and open the invoices and credit notes of that supplier.
<br/>
There is a first preview of the General Ledger Batch/Journal/Transaction screen, without any functionality yet.
<br/>
There is a first preview of simple maintenance screens, examples are Currency Setup and Exchange Rate Setup screens. They don't have functionality yet.
<br/><br/>
The point of these preview screens is to show how easy it is using scaffolding to generate new screens. 
The screens in the Accounts Payable module already have most of their functionality automatically generated, just a few special cases need to be programmed manually.

<h3>0.0.4.0: 13 July 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
The main new feature is the Accounts Payable supplier edit screen where you can edit new suppliers. For testing, first create a partner of type Organisation in the Partner module, and 
then go into the finance module, select Accounts Payable, and click on new supplier. It works to save the supplier, and to search for the supplier by either partner name or partner key.
The search box remembers the last 30 searches and autocompletes.
<br/>
Previews of the invoice edit screen and the supplier transaction screen have also been added, but they don't have functionality yet.
<br/><br/>
Some smaller bugs have been fixed, eg. when closing the partner edit screen with changed data and then saving when asked. Also the Partner Find now works with the enter key.
<br/><br/>
This release now supports PostgreSQL server again, the support was broken in 0.0.3.
<br/><br/>
This release comes not only with a standalone installer, but also with a server installer for Linux. That server installer only works with Postgresql at the moment. Please see the file INSTALL in the linux server tar.gz archive.
There is now also a remote client installer for Windows for OpenPetra installations that connect to a Linux server.

<h3>0.0.3.0: 20 June 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
<br/>
The new thing is that you can create a translation, and the Petra Client will use any language file that is located eg. in C:\Program Files\OpenPetra.org\bin30\locale\de\LC_MESSAGES. 
You might need to set the LANGUAGE variable in your Windows Environment Variables to use another language than is installed.
We do welcome translations, please have a look on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/openpetraorg/index.php?title=HowTo_help_with_Translation">wiki for instructions</a>.
<br/><br/>
The Finance module main screen can now be opened, and two prototype screens are available, for Gift processing from bank statements, and the main screen for Accounts Payable.
<br/><br/>
Please note that your database file will be replaced, and the backup you can still find here: eg. C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\OpenPetra.org\db30\petra.db.1.bak; we hope to integrate a patching system soon.
<br/><br/>
Some of the issues in the previous versions have been fixed, eg. the date in the Partner by city report does work now.

<h3>0.0.2.0: 13 June 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
The main visible new functionality is the &quot;Partner By City&quot; report. 
To test it, create a few partners in Partner Edit, and then run the report for those cities.
At the moment, this is limited to partners of type FAMILY; and there also seems to be a bug: 
if an address is only valid from today, the report would not show it; so set the valid date to a past date.
<br/><br/>
You may also notice the status bar with context sensitive help, depending on the field that currently is in focus. 
This is for example useful on Partner Edit, when it tells the meaning for each field.

<h3>0.0.1.3: 1 June 2009</h3>
This is the initial release of OpenPetra.org.<br/>
It only comes as a Standalone installation, using SQLite, to make the installation very simple.<br/>
<br/>
Login with User ID <b>demo</b> and password is <b>demo</b> as well.<br/>
<br/>
There are only 2 screens that actually provide functionality:<br/>
Go into the Partner module, and in the menu select &quot;Partner&quot; / &quot;New Partner&quot;.<br/>
You can create a new partner, add an address, and save the partner.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can go in the Partner Main screen in the menu to &quot;Partner&quot; / &quot;Find & Maintain Partner&quot;.<br/>
Search for the partner you just created.<br/>
To edit the partner, double click on the row in the result grid.<br/>
