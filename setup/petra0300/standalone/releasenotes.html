<h2>Release Notes OpenPetra.org (Preview)</h2>

<h3>0.0.2.0: 13 June 2009</h3>
Please see the previous release notes below as well!<br/>
The main visible new functionality is the &quot;Partner By City&quot; report. 
To test it, create a few partners in Partner Edit, and then run the report for those cities.
At the moment, this is limited to partners of type FAMILY; and there also seems to be a bug: 
if an address is only valid from today, the report would not show it; so set the valid date to a past date.
<br/><br/>
You may also notice the status bar with context sensitive help, depending on the field that currently is in focus. 
This is for example useful on Partner Edit, when it tells the meaning for each field.

<h3>0.0.1.3: 1 June 2009</h3>
This is the initial release of OpenPetra.org.<br/>
It only comes as a Standalone installation, using SQLite, to make the installation very simple.<br/>
<br/>
Login with User ID <b>demo</b> and password is <b>demo</b> as well.<br/>
<br/>
There are only 2 screens that actually provide functionality:<br/>
Go into the Partner module, and in the menu select &quot;Partner&quot; / &quot;New Partner&quot;.<br/>
You can create a new partner, add an address, and save the partner.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can go in the Partner Main screen in the menu to &quot;Partner&quot; / &quot;Find & Maintain Partner&quot;.<br/>
Search for the partner you just created.<br/>
To edit the partner, double click on the row in the result grid.<br/>
