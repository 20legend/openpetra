Npgsql is a .Net data provider for Postgresql.

current version: Npgsql 3.2.4.1

I have downloaded the stable version from nuget: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Npgsql/
and extracted the files Npgsql.dll and Npgsql.xml from the nupkg file, from path lib/net451

Mono.Security.dll is a managed dll, from Mono, which is required by Npgsql on Windows
