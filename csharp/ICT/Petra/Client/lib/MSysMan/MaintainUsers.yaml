#assumptions:
#  module is used to generate the namespace and to use the correct RemoteUIConnector
#  predefined operations: Add, Edit, Delete; if "operations" is set, only the listed operations are available
#  ClickHandler for each operation is generated
#  panel has default layout: OneControlPerRow
#  groupbox: same as panel, but with property label
#  labels are used with gettext
#  if there is no caption, the label is used for the caption in the list
#  all columns in the list are sortable by default (Symfony: =name)
#  controlType defines which control to use for the edit section
#  fields that are part of the primary key cannot be edited after the table has been saved
#  automatic check: no duplicates can be created
#todo:  
#  list should have paging, don't load data all at once
#  special lists, with parameters (e.g. cost centres, ledger number; partner, subscriptions)
#  generate toolbar with new, close, cancel, save, search? where to put retire/unretire?
#  validation: how to check for multiple user names? check for valid password?
#  more buttons per user: table permissions, module permissions, ledger permissions etc
#  another control: lookup available ledger numbers
