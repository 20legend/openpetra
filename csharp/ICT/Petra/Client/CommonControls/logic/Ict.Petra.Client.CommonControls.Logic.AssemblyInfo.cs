// @Description:
//         Namespace for Logic of GUI classes that either are UserControls, Custom Controls,
//         or custom PropertyGrid Editors which can be used anywhere in the Petra Client.
// @Comment:
//         Don't put Petra module specific controls or PropertyGrid Editors
//         in here. Rather put them into Petra module specific libraries,
//         eg. in Ict.Petra.Client.MPartner_CommonControls.dll
//         Also don't put controls or PropertyGrid Editors in here that are
//         not Petra specific. They would go in a ICT-wide library,
//         eg. in Ict.Common.CommonControls.dll
