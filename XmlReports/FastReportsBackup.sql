There's nothing in this file that's actually used. 
I'm only storing this here so that OpenPetra will detect the 
presence of the file and therefore store backups of the templates
in other *.sql files in this folder.

See CSharp\ICT\Petra\Server\lib\Mreporting\TemplateStore.cs, SaveTemplatesToBackupFile()
